# Python for Unity
An integration of [Python for .NET](https://github.com/pythonnet/pythonnet) delivered to your project through the Package
Manager, Python for Unity provides your Unity project the means to import the 
Python Runtime Environment as a namespace and execute Python scripts from the 
Unity editor.

With Python, you can facilitate Unity's interaction with various media and 
entertainment industry applications and ensure that Unity's integration into a
broader production pipeline can be done in a more seamless fashion. Some uses 
of Python in your Unity project could be:

- Automating scene and sequence assembly in the context of using Unity as a 
real-time renderer.
- Automating time consuming tasks like duplicating or modifying a large 
quantity of Assets.
- Authoring custom editor tools that could both use complex UI elements and 
interact natively with other DCC suites.
